# wxt536
python code for Vaisala wxt536 decoding, MQTT publishing, and wunderground PWS updating

### decodeMod.py:
    connect to WXT-536 via a Digi portserver TS 4 MEI (ethernet serial device)
    poll for data every POLLING_INTERVAL seconds
    Compute MSL pressure from station pressure and altitude
    Construct a JSON string and publish to q MQTT server, topic wxt/SERIAL_NUMBER
    Accept commands to send to WXT-536 device on wxt/SERIAL_NUMBER/cmd
    set station altitude in this file. Added code to read GPS messages and merge
    before publishing. WXT polling is controlled by GPS clock, /gps/SERIAL_NUMBER

### ingestMetTower.py
    read files of json met data (probably written by jsonListener.py), output to netCDF4 file
            
### jsonListener.py
    subscribe to wxt/SERIAL_NUMBER.  write all messages to json file.  open new files
    every day at 00:00 UTC
    
### jsonServer.py
    subscribe to wxt/SERIAL_NUMBER and build python dict of current observations
    create http server on PORT_NUMBER and return observations as JSON
    JSON shadow of mqtt data (OBSOLETE, use jsonStatic.py to generate json
    file to be served by webserver.  jsonServer.py python socket kept crashing)

### jsonStatic.py
    subscribe to wxt/SERIAL_NUMBER and build python dict of current observations
    create json file and place in web server directory.  JSON shadow of
    MQTT topic
                
### pwsweather.py:
    subscribe to wxt/SERIAL_NUMBER
    publish observations to www.pwsweather.com every PUBLISHING_INTERVAL seconds
    set pwsweather ID and PASSWORD in this file
               
### tower_ingest.pro
    Dave's IDL program to ingest NMEA-style strings into a netCDF file
 
### wunderground.py:
    subscribe to wxt/SERIAL_NUMBER
    publish observations to wunderground.com every PUBLISHING_INTERVAL seconds
    set wunderground ID and PASSWORD in this file

### wxboot.html
    html/css/javascript for display of weather info.  gets data from jsonServer.py
    Uses Bootstrap 4 to make metric/imperial buttons looks nicer
                  
### wxmobile.html
    html/css/javascript for display of weather info.  gets data from jsonServer.py
                  
### wxFormula.py:
    all your favorite unit conversions, convert station pressure to MSL pressure, etc.

### wxt536.out:
    some sample data strings as read from wxt-536

### wxt.settings:
    notes on how to configure wxt-536 for ASCII mode
